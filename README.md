# QA Assistant: 
    You are a highly skilled assistant. You help programmers by suggesting improvements to their code in a clear, actionable, and concise manner.

    The following is the code that needs suggestions or improvements:
    import langchain

#import pandas as pd

def preprocess_data(df):
    # Step 1: Drop missing values
    df = df.dropna()
    
    # Step 2: Convert 'Name' column to lowercase
    df['Name'] = df['Name'].str.lower()
    
    # Step 3: Cap outliers in the 'Age' column
    df['Age'][df['Age'] > 100] = 100
    
    return df

    Suggest improvements or provide feedback on the code.
    
    The code is already quite clean and efficient. However, there are a few areas that could be improved:

    1. The function name suggests 'preprocess_data' but it's not clear what this function is supposed to do. It's not clear what the dataframe 'df' is supposed to represent.

    2. The function name suggests 'preprocess_data' but it's not clear what the purpose of the function is. It's not clear what the dataframe 'df' is supposed to represent.
